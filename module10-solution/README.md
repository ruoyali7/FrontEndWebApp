# Restaurant

Restaurant front-end implementation in AngularJS for David Chu's China Bistro.

## Unit Tests (Jasmine)

### Run Unit Tests for `SignUpController`

We used Jasmine standalone runner to test the logic that checks if a favorite menu item exists.

To run tests:

1. Open this file in a browser:

MODULE10-SOLUTION/jasmine-standalone/SpecRunner.html

2. You should see this message:

2 specs, 0 failures

The specs test valid and invalid menu short names using mocked `$http` responses.
